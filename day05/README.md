# challenge-advent-of-code-2023-day5

Day 5's challenge is fun, but part 2 was full of traps for unefficient code.

The original code utilizes array to store the seeds, but it breaks due to an array wasnt able to store nearly 2 billion seeds.

The brute force code wasnt optimized enough.

## Directions

- reverse search
  - reverse search from location to seed
- brute force with a faster language (ie: C, C++, Rust)
  - Can be done within 5 minutes
- multi-thread / process brute force
  - implement this to learn multi-threading
- range maths + recurssion + node-traversing (optional)
  - sub second solution

Day 5 Part 2:

- reverse search
- range maths + recurssion
- multthread + process
